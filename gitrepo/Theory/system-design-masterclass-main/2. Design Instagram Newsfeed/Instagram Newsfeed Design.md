<hr style="border:2px solid gray">

### <p style="font-size: 24px; font-style: italic; color:red">CAPACITY ESTIMATION</p>

## DAU MAU Estimation

### How many users will be using your software?

#### Daily Active Users (DAU)
- ***500 million***

#### Monthly Active Users (MAU)
- ***2 billion***

<hr style="border:2px solid gray">

## Throughput Estimation

Let's calculate how many reads and writes we do to the system.

### Writes

There are only three possible ways to write (add data into the system) as per our functional requirements:

- **Creating Posts**
- **Following**
- **Commenting/Liking**

#### Post Creation Calculation

Assume 10% of all Daily Active Users (DAU) create posts in a day.

- Total DAU = **500 million**
- 10% of DAU create posts = **50 million users** create posts daily
- This results in **50 million 'create post' requests per day**

### Reads

Similarly, there is only one primary way to read data from our system:

- **User viewing news feed**

#### News Feed Viewing Calculation

Assume an average user reads **100 posts per day**.

- Total DAU = **500 million**
- Each user reads **100 posts per day**
- Total read requests = **500 million × 100 = 50 billion read requests per day**

<hr style="border:2px solid gray">

## Storage Estimation

### Post Data

Text posts are usually around **100 KB**, image posts around **0.5 MB**, and video posts around **20 MB**.  
From throughput estimation, we know there are **50 million ‘create post’ requests per day**.

Now, assume:
- **20% of posts** are text posts
- **60% of posts** are image posts
- **20% of posts** are video posts

#### Storage Calculation

##### **Text Data Storage**

(0.2 * 50M) * 100KB = 1TB/day


##### **Image Data Storage**

(0.6 * 50M) * 0.5MB = 15TB/day


##### **Video Data Storage**

(0.2 * 50M) * 20MB = 200TB/day


#### **Total Storage**

1TB + 15TB + 200TB = 216TB/day


### **Total Storage in 10 Years**

216TB/day * 365 * 10 = 750PB

<hr style="border:2px solid gray">

## Memory Estimation
### Cache Memory Size

Accessing data from the database takes a long time, but if we want to access it faster, we use cache.

### Cache Memory Requirement

The amount of cache memory required every day can simply be calculated as:
***1% of the daily storage = 0.01 × 216 TB = 2 TB/day***

### ***The memory size should also scale as our system grows.***

<hr style="border:2px solid gray">

## Network and Bandwidth Estimation

Network / Bandwidth estimation tells us how much data flows in and out of our system per second.  

### Data Flow Into Our System Per Second (Ingress)
Incoming data in a day is ultimately saved in storage.

- Data stored in a day = 216 TB per day  
- Incoming data per second:  
  **216 TB ÷ 86,400 = 2.5 GB/s**



### Data Flow Out of Our System (Egress)
Outgoing data refers to the data read from our system.

- Total read requests per day = 50 billion  
- Average post size:  
  **(0.2 × 100 KB) + (0.6 × 0.5 MB) + (0.2 × 20 MB) = 4.32 MB**  
- Total post reads per day:  
  **50 billion × 4.32 MB = 216 PB per day**  
- Outgoing data per second:  
  **216 PB ÷ 86,400 = 2.5 TB/s**

<hr style="border:2px solid gray">

### <p style="font-size: 24px; font-style: italic; color:red">API DESIGN</p>

## API DESIGN :Create a Text Post

Let's zoom into the 'communication' for creating a text post and understand exactly what's happening.

When we ask the server to create a text post, we use an API call. This is how computers talk to each other.

We will use a REST API for this communication. Here are the technical details:

![Text Post](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/99fa54_fb115664320e4806939e110a264cc02f~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1030,h_569,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/99fa54_fb115664320e4806939e110a264cc02f~mv2.png)

### HTTP Method  
This tells the server what action to perform. Since we want to create something new on the server, we use the `POST` action.

### Endpoint  
This tells the server where to perform that action. Since we are creating a post, we will use the `/v1/posts` endpoint of the server.

> 
**Note:**
```
 'v1' means version 1. It is a good practice to version your APIs.
```

### Example  
If, for example, you want to create a new user account, you would use the `POST` method and send the request to the `/v1/users` endpoint.

- **The action** → *What to do?* → `POST`  
- **The target** → *Where to do it?* → `/v1/users` (endpoint)

### HTTP Body  
We have told the server to create a text post, but we haven't provided the details of the text post itself. This information is sent in the request body:

```json
{
  "userId": "Your unique identifier",
  "text": "The content of your post",
  "hashtags": "The tags you include in your post"
}
```

<hr style="border:2px solid gray">

## API DESIGN :Create a Image or Video Post

Let's now zoom into the 'communication' for creating an image or video post and understand exactly what's happening.

Again, we will use a REST API for this communication. Here are the technical details:

![image Post](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/99fa54_31d0758517cb4e7e81fabe8a95f9607a~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_983,h_561,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/99fa54_31d0758517cb4e7e81fabe8a95f9607a~mv2.png)

### HTTP Method  
This tells the server what action to perform. Since we are creating something on the server, we will use the `POST` action.

### Endpoint  
This tells the server where to perform that action. Since we are creating a post, we will use the `/v1/posts` endpoint of the server.

### HTTP Body  
We use the HTTP Body to provide more details about the image post:

- **userId**: Your unique identifier.  
- **mediaUrl**: The web address (URL) where your uploaded image or video is stored.  
- **description**: The caption you write under your image or video.  
- **hashtags**: The tags you include in your post.  

*The flow for an image post and a video post is the same - only the media URL changes to a video file.*

<hr style="border:2px solid gray">

## API DESIGN :Like or Comment on a Post

Let's zoom into the 'communication' for liking or commenting on a post and understand exactly what's happening.

We will use a REST API for this communication. Here are the technical details:

![Like or comment](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/99fa54_64a07ce7ae7f4ebc87a4295fd0a9c272~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1023,h_581,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/99fa54_64a07ce7ae7f4ebc87a4295fd0a9c272~mv2.png)

### Commenting on a Post

### HTTP Method
This tells the server what action to perform. Since we are adding something to the server, we will use the `POST` action.


### Endpoint
This tells the server where to perform that action. Since we are adding a comment, we will use the `/v1/comments` endpoint of the server.

### HTTP Body
We use the HTTP Body to provide more details about the comment:

```json
{
  "userId": "Your unique identifier",
  "postId": "The unique identifier of the post you are commenting on",
  "comment": "The text of your comment"
}
```

## API DESIGN :Follow or Unfollow User

Let's zoom into the **'communication'** when we follow another user and understand exactly what's happening.

We will use a **REST API** for this communication. Here are the technical details:

![follow or unfollow](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/99fa54_a3debe5a635a44328f78f9746b94060a~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_953,h_499,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/99fa54_a3debe5a635a44328f78f9746b94060a~mv2.png)

### HTTP Method
This tells the server what action to perform. Since we are creating data on the server (a new follow relationship), we will use the **POST** action.

### Endpoint
This tells the server where to perform that action. Since we are following a user, we will use the `/v1/follow` endpoint of the server.

### HTTP Body
We use the HTTP Body to provide more details about the follow request:

```json
{
  "followerId": "Your unique identifier",
  "followeeId": "The unique identifier of the user you want to follow"
}
```
<hr style="border:2px solid gray">

## API DESIGN :Read NewsFeed aka Timeline

Let's zoom into the 'communication' for reading our news feed and understand exactly what's happening.

We will use a REST API for this communication. Here are the technical details:

![newsfeed](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/99fa54_94ad4cf93d4a430bb82af768c5c528b4~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_924,h_415,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/99fa54_94ad4cf93d4a430bb82af768c5c528b4~mv2.png)

## HTTP Method
This tells the server what action to perform. Since we want to fetch data from the server, we use the `GET` method.

## Endpoint
This tells the server where to perform the action. Since we are fetching the user's news feed, we will use the following endpoint:

```
/v1/feeds/{userId}
```

### Note:
`GET` requests do not include a body because they are used to fetch information, not to send data.

<hr style="border:2px solid gray">

### <p style="font-size: 24px; font-style: italic; color:red">HIGH LEVEL DESIGN</p>

## HIGH LEVEL DESIGN :Follow or Unfollow User

![follow hld](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/99fa54_a65fd37e59dc42c5ba328332daa39a54~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_753,h_455,al_c,lg_1,q_85,enc_auto/99fa54_a65fd37e59dc42c5ba328332daa39a54~mv2.png)

When the user follows or unfollows another user, the following steps are involved, corresponding to the numbers in the diagram:

## Follow User Process

1. **Follow Request**  
   When the user follows another user, a `POST` request is sent to the `/v1/follow` endpoint with the following request body:

   ```json
   {
     "followerId": "UserID1",
     "followeeId": "UserID2"
   }

2. **API Gateway Handling**
    The API Gateway handles the incoming request and routes it to the Follow Service via the Load Balancer.
    
3. **Database Update**
    The Follow Service updates the Follow Database (Graph DB) to reflect the new follower-followee relationship.

4. **Confirmation**
    The client receives confirmation of the successful follow request.

<hr style="border:2px solid gray">

## HIGH LEVEL DESIGN :Create Text Post

The following steps are involved in creating a text post, corresponding to the numbers in the diagram:

![create a text post](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/99fa54_169ce657e8d042198c50aca37ca8fc6c~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_856,h_176,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/99fa54_169ce657e8d042198c50aca37ca8fc6c~mv2.png)

1. When the user writes a text post and clicks submit, a **POST Request** is sent with the details of the text post.
2. The **API Gateway** handles the incoming request and routes it to the **Post Writer Service** via the **Load Balancer**.
3. The **Post Writer Service** saves the new post in the **Posts Database (Posts DB)**.
4. The **Client receives confirmation** of the successful post.

Effectively, up to this point, we've taken the user's post and saved it in the database.


### Reading the News Feed

When a user sends a request to read their **news feed**, we need to determine what the feed consists of. The news feed contains posts from **accounts the user follows**.

To retrieve these posts, the **News Feed Reader Service** performs the following steps:

1. **Finds all followed accounts** from the **Follow DB**.
2. **Reads posts** from these accounts using the **Posts DB**.
3. **Sorts all posts** in reverse chronological order (**newest to oldest**).
4. The **sorted posts are returned** as the user's news feed.


![create a text post2](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/99fa54_7db20c58c81b425eac3f934e59a7c7b2~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_875,h_275,al_c,lg_1,q_85,enc_auto/99fa54_7db20c58c81b425eac3f934e59a7c7b2~mv2.png)


### Performance Concerns

Following this design, reading the news feed involves multiple steps:
- **Read from the Follow DB**
- **Read from the Posts DB**
- **Sort the posts**

Each time someone reads their news feed, these operations are performed, which can **slow down the process**. Since users frequently check their news feeds, this delay can be frustrating.

However, in applications like **Instagram**, the news feed loads **very quickly**. 

### Optimizing the Design

So, we definitely need to optimize our design. 

**What can we do?** 🤔

## HIGH LEVEL DESIGN :Create Text Post 2

What if we can prepare the news feed in advance? This way, when someone tries to read their news feed, it will be instant because it is already prepared.

Let's see how this optimization works in the next steps.

## Here's what we'll do:

- As soon as the **Post Writer Service** saves a post in the **Posts DB**, it also puts an event (user ID and post ID) in a **Message Queue (MQ)**.
- The **News Feed Generator Service** will consume these events and add the new post to the news feed of all followers.
- This ensures that the news feed of all followers is pre-populated with the new post.

### **Benefits of Using Message Queue:**
- The **Post Writer Service** can put the event in the **Message Queue** and immediately move on to the next request. It doesn't have to wait for a response from the **News Feed Generator Service**.
- Meanwhile, the **News Feed Generator Service** processes each event from the queue and updates the affected news feeds for all followers. Updated Flow(Refer to the steps below the image):

![create a text post3](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/99fa54_5f54e1c9d794447abb6073177bef1f1d~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_883,h_646,al_c,q_90,enc_auto/99fa54_5f54e1c9d794447abb6073177bef1f1d~mv2.png)

1. **User writes a text post and clicks submit.**  
   - A `POST` request is sent with the text post.
   
2. **API Gateway handles the request.**  
   - It routes the request to the **Post Writer Service** via a **Load Balancer**.

3. **Post Writer Service saves the new post in the Posts DB.**

4. **Client receives confirmation of the successful post.**

5. **Post Writer Service puts the event (`postId`, `userId`) in a Message Queue (MQ).**

6. **News Feed Generator Service pulls the event from the Message Queue for processing.**

7. **News Feed Generator Service fetches the new post data from Posts DB using `postId`.**

8. **News Feed Generator Service finds all followers of the user using Follow DB.**

9. **News Feed Generator Service updates all followers' news feeds in the Feeds DB.**  
   - The Feeds DB maps each **UserId** to their **NewsFeed**:  
     ```
     UserId → { Post1, Post2, Post3 ... }
     ```

10. **Feed Cache is updated for faster access.**

By implementing this approach, the news feed is preloaded, leading to an instant and seamless experience for users.

<hr style="border:2px solid gray">

## HIGH LEVEL DESIGN :Create Image or Video Post

When creating a text post, we send the text data in the body. But how do we send image posts? Let's see.

### Uploading Images Efficiently

Sending images directly in a `POST` request body is not efficient. Images are large and can slow down the process.

### Better Approach: Upload and Use URL
Instead of sending the entire image in the request body, we:
1. First upload the image to the server.
2. Get the URL of the uploaded image, which points to the image location.
3. Send this URL in the request.

![create a image post hld](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/99fa54_737a7d493ffe465c99621ade40d6f6bc~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_918,h_650,al_c,q_90,enc_auto/99fa54_737a7d493ffe465c99621ade40d6f6bc~mv2.png)

### End-to-End Flow for Creating an Image / Video Post

The following steps outline the entire process of creating an image or video post:

### **1. Request a Pre-Signed URL**
The client requests a pre-signed URL from the API Gateway to upload the image/video.  
*Note:* A pre-signed URL is a special URL that allows the client to upload the image directly to Object Storage.

### **2. Generate Pre-Signed URL**
- API Gateway receives this request and routes it to the **Pre-Signed URL Generator Service** via Load Balancer.
- The **Pre-Signed URL Generator Service** generates the pre-signed URL and returns it to the client.

### **3. Upload Image/Video to Object Storage**
- The client uploads the image/video directly to **Object Storage** using the pre-signed URL.

### **4. Receive the Uploaded File URL**
- Object Storage returns the URL of the uploaded image/video to the client.

### **5. Send Post Request**
- The client uses this uploaded image/video URL in the request body & sends a `POST` request to the **API Gateway**.

### **6. Route Request to Post Writer Service**
- The API Gateway handles the incoming request and routes it to the **Post Writer Service** via Load Balancer.

### **7. Save Post in Database**
- The **Post Writer Service** saves the new post in the **Posts DB**.

### **8. Confirm Post Creation**
- The client receives confirmation of the successful post.

### **9. Publish Event to Message Queue**
- The **Post Writer Service** also puts this event (`postId`, `userId`) in a **Message Queue (MQ)**.

### **10. Generate News Feed**
- The **News Feed Generator Service** pulls this event from the **Message Queue** for further processing.

### **11. Retrieve Post Data**
- The **News Feed Generator Service** fetches the new post data from the **Posts DB** using `postId`.

### **12. Find Followers**
- The **News Feed Generator Service** finds all followers for this user using **Follow DB**.

### **13. Update Feeds DB**
- The **News Feed Generator Service** adds the new post to all followers' feeds.  
- This information is stored in the **Feeds DB**. Each entry in the **Feeds DB** maps `UserId` to their News Feed
```
UserId → { Post1, Post2, Post3 ... }
```
### **14. Update Feed Cache**
- The same information is also updated in the **Feed Cache** for faster access.

<hr style="border:2px solid gray">

## HIGH LEVEL DESIGN :Read Newsfeed aka timeline

Let's look at the end-to-end flow for reading the news feed. The following steps are involved, corresponding to the numbers in the diagram:

![newsfeed hld](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/99fa54_e44fc0aba55848c886aec4776b196e62~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1100,h_580,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/99fa54_e44fc0aba55848c886aec4776b196e62~mv2.png)

### Steps Involved

1. **User Request:**  
   When the user tries to load their news feed, a `GET` request is sent to the API Gateway on the `/v1/feeds/{userId}` endpoint.

2. **API Gateway Processing:**  
   The API Gateway receives the request and forwards it to the **NewsFeed Reader Service** via the **Load Balancer**.

3. **Fetching News Feed:**  
   The **NewsFeed Reader Service** fetches the pre-built news feed from the **Feed Cache**.

4. **Returning the News Feed:**  
   The **NewsFeed Reader Service** sends the news feed back to the user.

5. **Fetching Media Files:**  
   - The news feed only contains the URLs for the images and videos, not the actual media files.  
   - The client fetches the actual images and videos from the **CDN** using these URLs.  
   - If the content is not present in the **CDN**, it is retrieved from the **Object Storage**.

### Fun Fact
This is why sometimes images/videos fail to load if the internet connection is weak.

## HIGH LEVEL DESIGN :Comment on a post

When the user comments on a post, the following steps are involved, corresponding to the numbers in the diagram:

![comment on a post](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/99fa54_a5785479dcb9442fb7711ada5786e015~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_769,h_409,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/99fa54_a5785479dcb9442fb7711ada5786e015~mv2.png)

## Steps Involved

1. **User Submits a Comment**  
   - The user writes a comment and submits it.  
   - A `POST` request is sent to `/v1/comments` with the comment data.

2. **API Gateway Processing**  
   - The API Gateway handles the incoming request.  
   - It routes the request to the **Comment Service** via a **Load Balancer**.

3. **Comment Processing & Storage**  
   - The **Comment Service** processes the comment.  
   - It stores the comment in the **Comments Database**.

4. **Client Confirmation**  
   - The client receives confirmation that the comment was successfully posted.

5. **Event Sent to Message Queue (MQ)**  
   - The **Comment Service** puts an event (`userId`, `postId`) into a **Message Queue (MQ)**.

6. **Post Owner Notification**  
   - The **Notification Service** pulls the event from the **Message Queue**.  
   - It notifies the **post owner** about the new comment.

## HIGH LEVEL DESIGN :Like on a post

When the user likes a post, the following steps are involved, corresponding to the numbers in the diagram. Most of the flow is very similar to the "Comment on a Post" flow.

![Like on a post](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/99fa54_363f1846c7984165af10364e0bb7d92d~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1120,h_623,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/99fa54_363f1846c7984165af10364e0bb7d92d~mv2.png)

### Steps Involved

1. **User Action**  
   - The user likes a post and submits it.  
   - A `POST` request is sent to `/v1/likes` with the like data.

2. **API Gateway**  
   - The API Gateway handles the incoming request and routes it to the Like Service via a Load Balancer.

3. **Like Processing**  
   - The Like Service processes the like and stores it in the **Likes DB**.

4. **Cache Update**  
   - To speed up access, the **Likes Cache** is updated, mapping `postId` to the likes count, which appears in the news feed.

5. **Event Queueing**  
   - The Like Service also puts this event (`userId`, `postId`) in a **Message Queue (MQ)**.

6. **Notification Service**  
   - The Notification Service pulls this event from the **Message Queue** and notifies the post owner.

### Additional Consideration

As you observed, we updated the **Likes Cache** so that the number of likes can be displayed efficiently in the news feed. However, we haven't shown how the **Likes Cache** is actually used in the **read news feed** flow, so let's add that (Step - 3b).

## DEEP DIVE INSIGHTS :Database Selection

In order to decide the DB type, here are some **general** guidelines that you can follow, but **DO REMEMBER** it’s not always black and white. A lot of things depend on the project needs.

### SQL vs NoSQL Comparison

  <tr>
    <th>Criteria</th>
    <th>SQL</th>
    <th>NoSQL</th>

### Database Decision Table

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Database</th>
    <th>Deciding Factors</th>
    <th>Decision</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>PostsDB</b></td>
    <td>
      Social media posts can include text, images, videos, and metadata. Some posts have only text, some have only image or video. In short, it doesn't have a fixed structure.<br>
      Need to support 50 million create post requests per day, requires high scalability.<br>
      Simple query pattern - We are only reading posts by PostID in the news feed generation flow.
    </td>
    <td><b>NoSQL</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>FeedsDB</b></td>
    <td>
      Stores data as UserId -> [Post1, Post2, ...]. Post data doesn't have a fixed structure, so FeedDB is also unstructured.<br>
      As discussed, incoming number of posts have high scale (50 million), therefore FeedDB also needs to support high scale.<br>
      Simple query pattern - We are only reading news feed by userID in the news feed generation flow.
    </td>
    <td><b>NoSQL</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>CommentsDB</b></td>
    <td>
      Extremely high scale and throughput - 1.5 billion activities/day.<br>
      No fixed schema - Data may evolve in future to include replies to a comment aka nested comments (comment inside a comment).<br>
      Simple query pattern - We only need to find all the comments for a post.
    </td>
    <td><b>NoSQL</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>LikesDB</b></td>
    <td>
      Extremely high scale and throughput - 1.5 billion activities/day.<br>
      No fixed schema - Data may evolve in future to include like 'types' aka reactions (funny, wow, sad, love, ...).<br>
      Simple query pattern - We only do either of the things:<br>
      - Calculate # of likes and put in the Likes cache.<br>
      - Find all the users who liked a particular post.
    </td>
    <td><b>NoSQL</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>FollowDB</b></td>
    <td>
      In Follow DB, we are storing user connections and relationships - follower and followee data. We can use graphs to model this type of information - Users represented as nodes and their connections (follow/friend) as edges.<br>
      Using graph representation will also help to efficiently find followers and followees lists for a user.<br>
      We need to support a large number of users and their relationships.

## DEEP DIVE INSIGHTS :Data Modeling

### Posts Schema

- **Database Type:** NoSQL  
- **Common Queries:** Reading posts by `postId` in the news feed generation flow.  
- **Indexing:** `postId`  

![Posts Schema](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/99fa54_3115c0b8d91d41309fd481687447d0a0~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1030,h_384,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/99fa54_3115c0b8d91d41309fd481687447d0a0~mv2.png)

**Note:**  
Because we have this common query to grab posts by `postId`, we create an index on the `postId` field. Indexing on `postId` will set a shortcut to quickly find the data by `postId`.


### Feeds Schema

![Feeds Schema](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/99fa54_472615b722d2463088e33571e7d72d50~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_936,h_530,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/99fa54_472615b722d2463088e33571e7d72d50~mv2.png)

- **Database Type:** NoSQL  
- **Common Queries:** Reading news feed by `userId` in the news feed generation flow.  
- **Indexing:** `userId`  


### Comments Schema

- **Database Type:** NoSQL  
- **Common Queries:** Find all the comments for a post.  
- **Indexing:** `postId`  


### Likes Schema

![Likes Schema](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/99fa54_9daa0999bb6b46bbaba2a6b6fb204c59~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1080,h_384,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/99fa54_9daa0999bb6b46bbaba2a6b6fb204c59~mv2.png)

- **Database Type:** NoSQL  
- **Common Queries:**  
  1. Calculate the number of likes and put them in the Likes cache.  
  2. Find all the users who liked a particular post.  
- **Indexing:** `postId`  

### Follow Schema

![Follow Schema](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/99fa54_f7fff348107642ad988eef1bcf5d8ccd~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1120,h_415,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/99fa54_f7fff348107642ad988eef1bcf5d8ccd~mv2.png)

- **Database Type:** GraphDB  
- **Common Queries:** Quickly retrieve a user's followers and followees.  
- **Indexing:** `userId`

## DEEP DIVE INSIGHTS :Media Processing

When you create an image or video post, we upload the media file to Object Storage. However, there’s an important detail to consider. Different devices and internet speeds need different formats and resolutions. 

For example, a high-resolution image looks great on a desktop with a fast connection but may load slowly on a mobile phone with a slow connection.

### Solution: Multiple Formats and Resolutions

To solve this, we store the media file in multiple formats and resolutions.

![Media Processing](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/99fa54_a8721ae6075b49afb33a118e644fbe15~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_918,h_869,al_c,q_90,enc_auto/99fa54_a8721ae6075b49afb33a118e644fbe15~mv2.png)


### Media Processing Flow

1. **Upload to Object Storage**  
   - When a media file (image/video) is uploaded, it is stored in Object Storage.

2. **Media Processing Service**  
   - The Media Processing Service takes the uploaded file and converts it into different formats and resolutions.

3. **Store Converted Files**  
   - The converted media files are stored back in Object Storage.

4. **Adaptive Delivery**  
   - When a user has a poor connection, a lower resolution image is returned.  
   - When a user has a fast connection, a high-resolution image is served.

This ensures an optimal viewing experience across different devices and network conditions.

<hr style="border:2px solid gray">

## DEEP DIVE INSIGHTS :Pre Signed URLs

We used Pre-Signed URLs in the create media post flow. But what exactly are they, and why do we use them? Let's break it down.

### What are Pre-Signed URLs?

Pre-Signed URLs are special URLs that allow users to upload files directly to object storage (like Amazon S3) with temporary permissions. They are called "pre-signed" because they contain a signature that authorizes the client to upload for a limited time.

### Why Use Pre-Signed URLs?

- **Faster Uploads**: When a client uploads directly to the object storage, it doesn't burden the server. This makes the upload faster.
- **Secured & Temporary Access**: These URLs expire after a short period, ensuring they can't be used forever. This enhances security and prevents unauthorized access after expiration.
