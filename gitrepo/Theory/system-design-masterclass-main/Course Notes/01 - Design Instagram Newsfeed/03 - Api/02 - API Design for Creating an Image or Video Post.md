## **🔍 Understanding the API Call**

The process for creating an image or video post is similar to creating a text post, but with an additional step for handling the media file. The API request still follows the RESTful design:

### **Step 1: Choose the HTTP Method**
- Use the **📤 `POST`** method to create a new post.

### **Step 2: Define the Endpoint**
- The endpoint remains the same: **📍 `/v1/posts`**.

### **Step 3: Construct the Request Body**
The request body includes the following fields:
- **🆔 `user_id`**: Identifies the user creating the post.
- **📝 `description`**: The text description of the post.
- **🏷️ `hashtags`**: A list of hashtags included in the post.
- **🖼️🎥 `media_url`**: **This is the key difference.** It contains the URL of the media file (image or video) that has been uploaded to object storage.

## **🖼️🎥 Handling Media Files**

Before sending the API request to create the post, the client must first upload the media file to object storage.

1. **📤 Upload Media to Object Storage**
   - The client uploads the media file (image or video) to a cloud storage service.
   - After a successful upload, the storage service returns a **🌐 URL** that points to the uploaded file.

2. **📦 Include Media URL in the Request**
   - The returned **`media_url`** is then included in the request body when calling the API endpoint.

## **📝 Example API Request**

Here is an example of the API request for creating an image or video post:

### **Request**
- **📤 Method:** `POST`
- **📍 Endpoint:** `/v1/posts`
- **📦 Body:**

```json
{  
  "user_id": "12345",  
  "description": "Enjoying a beautiful sunset!",  
  "hashtags": ["#sunset", "#nature", "#photography"],  
  "media_url": "https://cloud-storage.com/uploads/sunset-photo.jpg"  
}
```

By separating the media upload process and leveraging object storage, this design ensures 📈 scalability, reduces 🖥️ server load, and supports 💾 large media file uploads.
