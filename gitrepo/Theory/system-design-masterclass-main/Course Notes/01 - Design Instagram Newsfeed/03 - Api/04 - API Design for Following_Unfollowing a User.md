### **Step 1: Choose the HTTP Method**
- Use the **📤 `POST`** method because we are creating a new follow relationship on the server.

### **Step 2: Define the Endpoint**
- The endpoint for following a user is:  
  **📍 `/v1/follow`**

### **Step 3: Construct the Request Body**
- The request body includes:
    - **🆔 `follower_id`**: The ID of the user who is initiating the follow action.
    - **🆔 `followee_id`**: The ID of the user being followed.

## 🚫 Unfollowing a User

### **Step 1: Choose the HTTP Method**

* Use the 🗑️ DELETE method because we are removing an existing follow relationship on the server.

### **Step 2: Define the Endpoint**

* The endpoint for unfollowing a user is:  
  📍`/v1/follow/{follower_id}/{followee_id}`  
  * **`{follower_id}`**: The ID of the user initiating the unfollow action.  
  * **`{followee_id}`**: The ID of the user being unfollowed.

### **Step 3: Request Body (Not Applicable)**

*  **`DELETE`** requests typically do not require a request body, as the required information is included in the URL.

### 📝 Example API Request for Unfollowing a User

`DELETE /v1/follow/12345/67890`

This design ensures 🎯 clarity and ✨ simplicity while maintaining RESTful API principles.
