## **✨ Benefits of Capacity Estimation**

1. **📦 Resource Allocation**

   - Accurate capacity estimation helps determine the number of **🖥️ servers**, **🗄️ databases**, and other **🛠️ hardware components** required to support the system's needs.
   - ***Example**:* If a server handles **1 million requests per hour** and you anticipate **10 million requests per hour**, you'll need **10 servers**.


2. **💰 Cost Management**

   - Capacity estimation prevents **📉 overprovisioning** or **📈 underprovisioning** of resources, leading to **💸 cost savings** by avoiding wasted resources or performance bottlenecks.


3. **🖥️ Hardware Selection**

   - Capacity needs inform the choice of **🔧 hardware types** and **📋 specifications**.
   - ***Example**:* If a system requires **10 million queries per hour**, and SQL databases can only handle **50k queries per hour** while NoSQL databases handle **1 million**, the **NoSQL database** is the more suitable choice.


4. **⚖️ Read/Write Load Balancing**

   - Capacity estimation, specifically **📊 throughput analysis**, helps determine if a system is **📖 read-heavy** or **📝 write-heavy**.
   - This knowledge influences **🗂️ database selection** and **🚀 optimization strategies**.
   - ***Example:*** A system with **80% reads** and **20% writes** may require a **🧠 caching layer** to optimize read performance.
