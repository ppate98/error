---

### **🎯 Central Goal:**

Building **efficient systems** ⚙️

---

### **🌳 Main Branches:**

---

#### **1\. 🛠️ Functionality**

* The system works **reliably** and as expected. ✅

---

#### **2\. 🖥️ Usability**

* The system is **easy to understand** and navigate. 🧭

---

#### **3\. 📈 Scalability**

* **Definition:** The ability to handle increasing users and data. 📊

* **Analogy (Bakery):** 🥐
  * **1 cashier:** Represents the initial system.
  * **More customers:** Increased demand. 👥
  * **Lines and frustration:** Scalability issues. 😤
  * **Solution:** Adding cashiers to meet demand. 🧑‍💼🧑‍💼🧑‍💼
  * **Outcome:** 3 cashiers represent a scaled system. 🎉

---

#### **4\. ⏳ Availability**

* **Definition:** The time the system is operational. 🕒

* **Analogy (24/7 Convenience Store):** 🏪
  * Always open and accessible. 🔓
* **Example:** Online banking. 💳

* **Key Metric:**
  * **"Nines" (e.g., 99.999% availability):**
    * Equals **5 minutes of downtime per year**. ⏱️

---

#### **5\. 🔄 Consistency**

* **Definition:** Ensuring everyone sees the same information at the same time. 👀

* **Analogy (Teacher):** 👩‍🏫
  * A teacher announces a test. 📢
  * **Consistent:** All students hear the announcement at the same time. 🎧
  * **Inconsistent:** Only some students hear it. 🤷‍♂️

* **Types of Consistency:**
  * **Strong Consistency:** 💪
    * Information is updated immediately across all systems. ⚡
    * **No delays.** 🚫
    * **Example:** Bank balance updates instantly after a withdrawal. 💸

  * **Eventual Consistency:** 🕒
    * Information is updated gradually. 🔄
    * Users may see outdated data temporarily until synchronization is complete. 📉
    * **Example:** Social media likes on a post taking a few seconds to reflect. 👍

---

#### **6\. ⚡ Performance**

* Ensures the system responds **quickly** to user requests. 🏃‍♂️

* **Key Metrics:**
  * **Latency:** Time taken to process a single request. ⏱️
  * **Throughput:** Number of requests the system can handle per second. 🚀

* **Example:**
  * A search engine delivering results in milliseconds. 🔍

---

#### **7\. 🔧 Reliability**

* The system **consistently performs** its intended function under expected conditions. 🛠️

* **Example:**
  * A messaging app reliably delivering messages even during high traffic. 💬

---

#### **8\. 🔒 Security**

* Protects the system and user data from **unauthorized access** or breaches. 🛡️

* **Key Aspects:**
  * **Authentication:** Ensures only authorized users can access the system. 🔑
  * **Encryption:** Secures data in transit and at rest. 🔐

* **Example:**
  * A banking app requiring two-factor authentication (2FA). 📱

---

#### **9\. 🛠️ Maintainability**

* The system can be easily **updated, debugged, and enhanced** over time. 🔄

* **Example:**
  * Modular codebases allowing quick bug fixes and feature updates. 🧩

---

#### **10\. 💰 Cost Efficiency**

* Balances performance and scalability with **cost-effectiveness**. 💸

* **Example:**
  * Using auto-scaling services to reduce infrastructure costs during low traffic. 📉
