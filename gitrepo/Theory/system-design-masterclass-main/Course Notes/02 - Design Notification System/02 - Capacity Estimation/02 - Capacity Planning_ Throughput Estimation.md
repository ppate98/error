# **📊 Capacity Planning: Throughput Estimation**

This document explains the concept of throughput and how to estimate it for a notification system. It focuses on understanding the volume of data flowing into and out of the system.

Throughput measures the amount of data processed by a system within a specific timeframe. In the context of our notification system, it refers to the number of notifications generated and delivered per second.

## **💡 Importance of Throughput Estimation**

1. **📈 Scalability:** Ensures the system can handle increasing loads as the user base grows.
2. **⚡ Performance:** Helps maintain quick response times, even during peak usage.
3. **🔒 Reliability:** Prevents bottlenecks or crashes by predicting and planning for high data flow scenarios.

---

## **📋 Factors Influencing Throughput**

1. **👥 Number of Users:**
   * Daily Active Users (DAU) and Monthly Active Users (MAU).
2. **📅 Notification Frequency:**
   * Average number of notifications sent per user daily.
3. **📨 Delivery Channels:**
   * Different channels (e.g., SMS, email, push notifications) may have unique throughput constraints.
4. **📦 Payload Size:**
   * Larger payloads (e.g., multimedia messages) may require more bandwidth and processing power.

---

## **📝 Steps to Estimate Throughput**

1. **📊 Gather Metrics:**
   * Collect data on DAU, MAU, and average notifications per user.
2. **📈 Analyze Peak Usage:**
   * Identify peak times and calculate the maximum notification load.
3. **⏱️ Determine Delivery Latency Goals:**
   * Define acceptable delivery timeframes for different notification types.
4. **🛠️ Simulate Load:**
   * Use tools to simulate high traffic and measure the system's capacity.

## **📊 Example Calculation**

1. **📋 Metrics Assumed:**
   * DAU: 1,000,000 users
   * Average notifications per user daily: 5

2. **📅 Daily Throughput:**
   * Total notifications = 1,000,000 x 5 = 5,000,000

3. **⏱️ Per Second Throughput:**
   * Assuming peak usage lasts for 2 hours (7,200 seconds):
   * Throughput = 5,000,000 / 7,200 ≈ 694 notifications/second

## **⚙️ Optimizing Throughput**

1. **📦 Use Caching:**
   * Reduce processing time for frequently accessed data.
2. **💻 Optimize Code:**
   * Ensure efficient algorithms for processing notifications.
3. **⚖️ Load Balancing:**
   * Distribute traffic across multiple servers to avoid overloading.
4. **📈 Scale Infrastructure:**
   * Add servers or increase bandwidth as needed.

## **🎯 Conclusion**

Estimating and optimizing throughput is critical to building a robust notification system. By understanding the data flow and planning for peak usage, we can ensure the system remains efficient, scalable, and reliable.
