## **🔧 Decoupling Responsibilities**

In the previous design, the **User Preference Service** performed dual roles:

* Filtering notifications based on user preferences.
* Routing notifications to delivery services.

This mixed responsibility limited modularity. The new design introduces the **Notification Sender Service**, which exclusively handles notification delivery to target users. This decoupling improves both modularity and maintainability.

## **🛠️ Introducing Specialized Notification Senders**

Initially, a single Notification Sender Service was proposed to handle all notification types. However, this approach had challenges:

1. **🧩 Complexity of Protocols**
    * Each notification type (e.g., SMS, email, push) has unique protocols and integration requirements, making centralized management difficult.

2. **📈 Scalability Limitations**
    * A single service cannot process all notification types simultaneously, creating bottlenecks when demand spikes for specific types.

To overcome these issues, the system now includes **specialized notification sender services**:

* **🍎 iOS Notification Sender**: Manages iOS push notifications via APNs.
* **🤖 Android Notification Sender**: Handles Android push notifications via FCM.
* **📱 SMS Notification Sender**: Sends SMS notifications through Twilio.
* **📧 Email Notification Sender**: Manages email notifications using Mailchimp.

## **📨 Optimized Notification Flow**

The notification flow, incorporating specialized senders, follows these steps:

1. **📨 Client Request**
    * The client sends a notification request to the API Gateway.

2. **🛣️ API Gateway Routing**
    * The API Gateway forwards the request to the Validation Service.

3. **🔍 Validation**
    * The Validation Service verifies recipient details.

4. **🚦 Prioritization**
    * The Prioritization Service assigns priority levels to notifications.

5. **⏳ Rate Limiting**
    * The Rate Limiter ensures notifications adhere to frequency restrictions.

6. **⚙️ User Preference Filtering**
    * The User Preference Service filters notifications based on user preferences.

7. **📤 Specialized Sender Routing**
    * Notifications are routed to the corresponding specialized sender service:
        * **🍎 iOS Sender (APNs)**.
        * **🤖 Android Sender (FCM)**.
        * **📱 SMS Sender (Twilio)**.
        * **📧 Email Sender (Mailchimp)**.

8. **🤝 Third-Party Service Interaction**
    * Each sender service interacts with its respective third-party delivery platform.

9. **📤 Delivery**
    * Notifications are delivered to the target users via the selected platform.

## **✅ Benefits of Specialized Senders**

1. **⚡ Improved Efficiency**
    * Services focus on specific notification types, streamlining delivery and protocol handling.

2. **📈 Enhanced Scalability**
    * Supports parallel processing of different notification types, addressing varying demands efficiently.

3. **🔧 Simplified Maintenance**
    * Specialized services isolate concerns, facilitating easier updates and system management.
