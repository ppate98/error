# **📡 High-Level Design: Adding Validation and Prioritization Microservices**

This document refines the high-level design of the notification system by introducing new components: microservices for validation and prioritization, an API gateway, and a user information database.

## **🔧 Enhancing the Design**

The refined system includes the following components:

1. **🚪 API Gateway**
   * Acts as a traffic controller, routing notification requests to the appropriate services.
   * Centralizes request handling and enhances system organization.

2. **👤 User Info Database**
   * Stores user data, such as usernames, email addresses, and phone numbers.
   * Provides necessary data for validating notification requests.

3. **🔍 Validation Service**
   * Ensures notifications are sent to correct recipients by verifying user data against the database.

4. **🚦 Prioritization Service**
   * Assigns priority levels to notifications based on urgency, ensuring critical notifications (e.g., security alerts) are promptly delivered.

## **📨 Refined Notification Flow**

The revised flow of notifications is as follows:

1. **📨 Client Request**
   * The client submits a notification request to the API Gateway.

2. **🛣️ API Gateway Routing**
   * Routes the request to the Validation Service.

3. **🔍 Validation**
   * The Validation Service retrieves data from the User Info Database.
   * If user data doesn’t match, the request is rejected.

4. **🚦 Prioritization**
   * Valid requests proceed to the Prioritization Service.

5. **⚙️ Prioritization Logic**
   * Notifications are prioritized using predefined rules.

6. **📤 Delivery Service Routing**
   * The notification is forwarded to the relevant delivery service:
      * **🍎 APNs** for iOS push notifications.
      * **🤖 FCM** for Android push notifications.
      * **📱 Twilio** for SMS.
      * **📧 Mailchimp** for emails.

7. **📤 Delivery**
   * The notification is sent to the target user via the appropriate service.

## **✅ Benefits of the Refined Design**

1. **⚡ Improved Efficiency**
   * The API Gateway organizes and streamlines request routing.

2. **🔒 Enhanced Security**
   * Validation Service ensures secure and accurate recipient data.

3. **🚨 Prioritized Delivery**
   * Urgent notifications are delivered promptly by the Prioritization Service.

4. **🧩 Modularity and Scalability**
   * Microservices allow modular design and independent scaling of validation and prioritization.
